# A standard PHP project skeleton
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/koriym/Koriym.PhpSkeleton.svg?branch=1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/koriym/Koriym.PhpSkeleton)

Are you tired of copy-pasting your boilerplate PHP code whenever you need to start a new project?

This repository contains a single-line command that will automatically setup for you all the needed code to create a modern, clutter-free and test-oriented PHP package.

It will automatically install the following dependencies:

* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/): provides testing framework.
* [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki): detects violations of a defined set of coding standards.
* [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org): analyze your code to detect sub-optimal or overly complex code.
* [PHPStan](https://phpmd.org): discover bugs in your code without running it.
* [Psalm](https://psalm.dev): - another static analysis tool from Vimeo.
* [PHPMetrics](https://www.phpmetrics.org) provides various metrics.

As well as config file for popular continuous integration tool.
 
## Create Project
